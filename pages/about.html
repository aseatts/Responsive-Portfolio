                                15 years of data management experience with a team-based approach to design and implementation. Data solutions with emphasis
                                on customer satisfaction and consistency. I specialize in all things data: logical, physical,
                                migration, management, and stewardship.

                                Data is knowledge, power, and money. Today, how a company uses or missuses its data can define its success; and its ability
                                to dominate its competitors. Data is not limited financial statements and work queues, we
                                are in the age of data. Using data is knowing which customers are the best customers for
                                your service; and knowing how to help them select the perfect home quickly at the right price.
                                Itâ€™s having the flexibly to support cross-marketing efforts to generate additional revenue
                                and providing additional services for good customers. It means more higher profit and lower
                                costs. It is a gift that the passion I have for data overlaps with the time we live in.
